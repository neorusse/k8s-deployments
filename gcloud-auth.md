```console
# Where the region is us-east1
gcloud config set compute/region us-east1

Updated property [compute/region].
```

```console
# Where the zone inside the region is us-east1-c
gcloud config set compute/zone us-east1-c

Updated property [compute/zone].
```

```console
# Where the project name is my-project-name
gcloud config set project my-project-name

Updated property [core/project].
```
